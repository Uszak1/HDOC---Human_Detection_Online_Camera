This code works on most all cameras (i hope so), i tested 4 difrent one and i have no trouble with sending data to cloud.
Code sends present view of conected camera on internet host, in the code it is 4243 but you can change it however you want.
To activate the code you need all things meansioned in "required", working machinal devise (computer/laptop), python and acces to internet. 

To acctualy run the script follow simple instruction:
1. Copy and paste, script from WebCam_Sendhost.py to your device.
2. Import all the liberians with commnad:
   "pip install flask opencv-python socket"
   if dosn't work try:
   "apt get python3 flask"
   "apt get python3 opencv-python"
   or:
   "python3 /m pip install "flask""
   "python3 /m pip install "opencv-python""
You may stand apond more issues with that, than try updating python.
3. Save and run your program:
   save program on your device and try running it.
   there shouldn't be any issues with the code.
