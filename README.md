This is Web Cam Sending Script. 
It works by sending data to cloud on specified host.

Code is running quite smoothly and with no issues (as for me). 
I checked, and code was working with 4 difrent web-cams and I have no trouble with sending data to the cloud.
I hope code is also working for you.

Code sends view from camera to internet website with ip and host, in the code the host is 4545 but you can change it however you want.
To activate the code you need everything explained in "required" file.

To acctualy run the script follow this simple instruction:
1. Copy and paste the script from WebCam_Sendhost.py to your device.
2. Import all the liberians from "import" file based on your operating system and python that you're using.
3. Save and run your program:
   save program on your device and try running it.
   You may find errors on python before 3.12 and operating system win below 10 (there shouldn't be any errors on linux).
4. Open internet web with host provided from the code.
5. Enyoj working camera. 

I hope code is working properly, if not you can contact me, I'm here ready to help with any issues with download or with data sending, you can leave your feed and issues. Thanks for helping me out.

Keep in mind that this is an early development tool.
