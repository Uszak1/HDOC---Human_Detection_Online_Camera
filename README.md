This code works probably with all cameras (i hope so), I tested 4 difrent one and I have no trouble with sending data to the cloud.

Code sends present view of conected camera on internet host, in the code the host is 4243 but you can change it however you want.
To activate the code you need all things from "required".

To acctualy run the script follow simple instruction:
1. Copy and paste, script from WebCam_Sendhost.py to your device.
2. Import all the liberians from import.cmd file
3. Save and run your program:
   save program on your device and try running it.
   there shouldn't be any issues with the code.

I hope you enyoj itz and it's working, If not you can contact me with any issues and I will try explain them and may fix some errors in the code. I'm looking forward to hear your feed.
