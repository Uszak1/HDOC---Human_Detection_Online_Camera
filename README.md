This is Web Cam Sending Script with ai human face detection.
=
I checked, and code was working with 4 difrent web-cams and I have no trouble with sending data to the cloud.
I really hope the code is also working for you.


Code sends view from automaticly-detected camera to internet website with ip and host. 
Script sends data on host 4545 but you can change it however you want.
To activate the code you need everything explained in "required" file.

To acctualy run the script follow this simple instruction:
1. Download the script from WebCam_Sendhost.py to your device.
2. Import all the liberians from "import" file based on your operating system and python that you use.
3. Save and run your program:
   save program on your device and try running it.
4. Open internet webpage with host provided from the code.
5. Enyoj human face detector.

I hope code is working properly, if not you can contact me, I'm here ready to help with any issues including download issues or data sending, you can leave your feed and issues. Thanks for helping me out growing up.

Tool is constantly beeing improwe and it is still not finished.
